# microsim

A micro-simulator of Australia's personal income tax system.

This micro-simulator will do single year costing of tax changes as well as distributional and gender analysis.

At the moment it uses the 2015-16 ATO 2 per cent sample as its base dataset and all analysis is for 2019-20.

## Dependencies

This package depends on the tidyverse and three of my other packages:

* taxFunctions (functions to calculate Australian taxes)
* ozTaxData (A cleaned up version of the ATO's 2 per cent sample)
* themeTom (my preferred ggplot2 defaults)
